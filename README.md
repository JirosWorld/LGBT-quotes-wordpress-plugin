# LGBT-quotes-wordpress-plugin
LGBT quotes Wordpress plugin.  
A queer plugin spin-off of Hello Dolly that displays inspirational quotes for people of all LGBT rainbow diversities. When activated you will randomly see a quote displayed in a pink bubble at the upper right of your admin screen on every page.

### Installation

Download this directory and save the ZIP file somewhere on your computer. In the admin dashboard of your self-hosted WordPress installation, the CMS can install the plugin for you. Use the 'plugin add new' installer screen in your dashboard. After this, you will see a success message. Don't forget to activate the plugin.  
Or upload the unzipped file to the WP-content folder of your self-hosted Wordpress installation. Again don't forget to activate the plugin.
